* Fixed a streaming issue with newer PHP 5.6 versions and later.
* Stream::setIsBlocking() is only implicitly called if needed (i.e. for encrypted connections), ensuring compatibility with web hosts that for bizzare reasons have disabled stream_set_blocking().
* Doc and test fixes that now ensure large code coverage.
